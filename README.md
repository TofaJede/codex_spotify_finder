# Spotify Finder

A simple vanilla JavaScript app that searches Spotify for albums released in a selected genre over a custom date range.

## Usage

1. Obtain a Spotify access token using the Client Credentials Flow and expose it as a global variable `SPOTIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` before loading `app.js`.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Select a genre, adjust the start and end dates if needed, and click **Search** to view recent albums.
